    This project aims to analyze the **Heart Disease UCI Dataset** and build a machine learning model 
    to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The dataset contains features such as:
    - Age, Gender, and Cholesterol Levels
    - Chest Pain Type and Resting Blood Pressure
    - Maximum Heart Rate Achieved and more.

    The project is divided into the following sections:
    1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights and visualizations to understand the dataset.
    2. **Machine Learning Model:** Training and evaluation of a classification model.
    3. **Conclusion:** Highlights of the project and its findings.
